# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
This project sought to visually story tell the results of an analysis of the FIFA 2018 Player ratings dataset.
Some of the analysis included identifying top performing players based on ratings, comparing the attributes that make up for good performance within a playing position and analysing the ratings of the players within different environments such as their clubs and their national teams.
Furthermore, criteria such as age was looked at to determine how or if player attributes are affected by age.

## Results
My data was based on the FIFA 2018 player ratings dataset.
My data question was based on the satement; indepth analysis of high ranking players. I analysed their performance for national as well as club duty. Furthermore, I looked at their earnings and also how those wages may differ based on position played. With regards to position, I also looked at the different attributes, on avaerage, which make up for good performance within those positions. For the attributes, I looked at how age may affect the attributes.

It was interesting to note that the highest ranked was second in terms of wages despite playing the same position with the highest paid. This could be due to the value of the clubs as well as value being derived from sponsorship opportunities.

From the boxplots which I made to analyse and check for outliers, I noticed that in terms of player rating for the club, the highest rated player was not necessarily an outlier as their score of 94 was the upper whisker, on a box with a median of 83. This was Cristiano Ronaldo for the Real Madrid club. For the national team, he was an outlier, the upper whisker being 84, compared to his overall score of 94, the box having a median of 71. This means that the standard of play is much higher in the club team compared to the national team and changes can be made to strengthen the latter team.

Another point of interest was the wages. The positions that are central and advance to the opponent's goal area get more in payment. This may be because these people, while playing as part of a team, become more prominent as they are usually noted for goal scoring and usually become the face of the team, often becoming crowd pullers during matches.

It was interesting to note how age did not seem to affect some attributes such as aggression, acceleration and stamina. Of note is how each position requires certain attributes for optimum performance, for example, a striker may need more acceleration and less aggression when compared to a defensive midfielder, as the striker seeks to score and the defender seek to protect their goal line against the strikers.

## Challenges 
The data on preferred positions made it difficult to zero in on particular positions without the influence of any other position, for example, for a player who prefers the central attacking midfielder, centre back and central defensive midfielder, it is difficult to determine the attributes of one of the roles without being biased by the others.

## Future Goals
Perform more predictive analysis based on potential or current performance ratings.
