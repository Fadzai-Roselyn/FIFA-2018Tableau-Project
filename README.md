# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
This project sought to visually story tell the results of an analysis of the FIFA 2018 Player ratings dataset.
Some of the analysis included identifying top performing players based on ratings, comparing the attributes that make up for good performance within a playing position and analysing the ratings of the players within different environments such as their clubs and their national teams.
Furthermore, criteria such as age was looked at to determine how or if player attributes are affected by age.

## Process
### Saved my csv dataset as an excel dataset and imported it in to Tableau for analysis
### Generated multiple visualizations to better understand the data

## Results
I chose option 2 to allow for independent questions and answers as a challenge to myself. My data was based on the FIFA 2018 player ratings dataset.
My data question was based on the satement; indepth analysis of high ranking players. I analysed their performance for national as well as club duty. Furthermore, I looked at their earnings and also how those wages may differ based on position played. With regards to position, I also looked at the different attributes, on avaerage, which make up for good performance within those positions. For the attributes, I looked at how age may affect the attributes.

## Challenges 
The data on preferred positions made it difficult to zero in on particular positions without the influence of any other position, for example, for a player who prefers the central attacking midfielder, centre back and central defensive midfielder, it is difficult to determine the attributes of one of the roles without being biased by the others.

## Future Goals
Perform more predictive analysis based on potential or current performance ratings.
